There are two ways to install Word GPT Plus: through my free hosting service, or by self-hosting it.

Rest assured that your privacy is protected as all data is saved using localStorage.

However, if you desire faster speeds and possess expertise with Node.js, self-hosting is also an option.

## How to fill in access token or API key

After entering Word GPT Plus, click the orange `Settings` button on the homepage to enter the settings page, where you can switch APIs and fill in access tokens or API keys.

## How to get access token

### email + password accounts

To use ChatGPT web API, you'll need an OpenAI access token from the ChatGPT webapp. To do this, you can use any of the following methods which take an email and password and return an access token:

- Node.js libs
  - [ericlewis/openai-authenticator](https://github.com/ericlewis/openai-authenticator)
  - [michael-dm/openai-token](https://github.com/michael-dm/openai-token)
  - [allanoricil/chat-gpt-authenticator](https://github.com/AllanOricil/chat-gpt-authenticator)
- Python libs
  - [acheong08/OpenAIAuth](https://github.com/acheong08/OpenAIAuth)

These libraries work with email + password accounts (e.g., they do not support accounts where you auth via Microsoft / Google).

### Microsoft / Google accounts

Alternatively, you can manually get an accessToken by logging in to the ChatGPT webapp and then opening `https://chat.openai.com/api/auth/session`, which will return a JSON object containing your accessToken string.

**Access tokens last for days.**
